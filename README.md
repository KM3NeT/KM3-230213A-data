# Data for the KM3-230213A high energy event observation

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgit.km3net.de%2Fopen-data%2Fpublic-candidates%2Fvhe-event/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2FReading+Data.ipynb)

This repository contains open data and methods to supplement the publication *Observation of an Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Neutrino with KM3NeT*, available at XXX.

In this publication, the observation of an exceptionally high-energy neutrino event in the PeV-range by the KM3NeT neutrino telescope is reported. Here, you can find supplementary information to reproduce and reuse selected outcomes cited in the publication.

## Overview

The repository is mainly based on the use of Jupyter notebooks and provides an interactive event display. You can find the relevant notebooks in the `notebooks` folder, which also exemplifies how to read the data provided in `data`, and the event display in Ã¨vent-display`. As some analyses require special dependencies, ensure that you set up the environment accordingly as explained below in *Getting started*.

### Project Structure
- `data/`: Input data for the notebooks, supplementary data and single hit information for the event
- `event-display/`: Interactive event display of the event based on Julia
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks to document the final analysis steps and produce outcomes shown in the publication
- `src/`: Supplementary scripts and functions

### Contents

The following parts of the publication can be reproduced here:

#### Figures
- Julia-based event display (Figure 1): `/event-display` in a specialized Julia environment
- Distribution of number of hits for simulation of neutrinos of 10, 100 and 1000 PeV (Figure 2): `/notebooks/Simulated number of PMTs.ipynb`
- Skymap in the direction of KM3-230213A (Figure 4): `/notebooks/Skymap.ipynb`
- Comparison of the astrophysical flux with measurements and theoretical predictions, (Figure 5): `/notebooks/Astrophysical flux comparions.ipynb`
- Time residual distribution of the event hits (Extended Data, Figure 7): `/notebooks/Hit distributions.ipynb`
- Topography in the direction of the event (Extended Data, Figure 9): `/notebooks/Site topography.ipynb`
- Emission point of photons along the reconstructed muon trajectory (Extended Data, Figure 11): `/notebooks/Hit distributions.ipynb`

#### Tables
- Expected number of track events for a variety of diffuse astrophysical fluxes (Table 4): `/notebooks/Expected events per flux.ipynb`

## Getting started

You can run the repository locally on your machine (recommended in venv or conda environment) or on binder.

### Adding full data

For the full use of all notebooks, you have to retrieve the full dataset for `/data` from the KM3NeT Open Data Center, as explained in `/notebooks/Reading Data.ipynb`. A download function is provided, or you can directly download larger files from the [data set](https://opendata.km3net.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.5072%2FFK2%2FJW72C9).

### Using mybinder

Launch the repository on mybinder following this link: [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/https://git.km3net.de/open-data/public-candidates/vhe-event/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2FReading+Data.ipyn](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/https://git.km3net.de/open-data/public-candidates/vhe-event/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2FReading+Data.ipyn).

### Run the repository locally

Firstly, download the whole content of the repository using `git` or just directly from the download function:
```sh
git clone git@git.km3net.de:open-data/public-candidates/uhe-event.git
```

then change into the code repository:
```sh
cd uhe-event/
```

#### Creating the environment

##### Using conda
In order to use conda to build the environment, conda has to be installed. To see how, use these [Installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/).

Build environment using `conda` from `_environment.yml` file:
```sh
conda env create -f _environment.yml
conda activate uhe_event
```

##### Using venv

It requires to build a dedicated environment.
Build environment using `pip`:
```sh
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv venv

```
acitvate `venv`:
```sh
# on Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
# on Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install necessary packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using Jupyter
In order to run the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed. You can install it using `pip install jupyter` or following the instructions at the [Juypter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

##### Running the Jupyter kernel

Jupyter notebook kernel and launch your notebook:
```sh
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=uhe_event
jupyter-notebook
```
And for `zsh` shell, you need to execute these lines first before installation of the kernel
```zsh
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels
```

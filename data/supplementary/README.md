# Supplementary data

## Detector information

In the `/detector` folder, the detector configuration file is stored as `.datx` in the generic KM3NeT format as used by the event display, and as compressed json file for calculation of the git distributions, see the notebook `notebook/Hit distributions.ipynb`.

## Simulations and simulation results

This folder contains the KM3NeT effective area for the event, and the simulation data used for Figure 2 are stored here when downloaded from the Open Data Centre.


## Publication figures

This folder contains files requested by Nature for the reproduction of plots, which are also used in the respective notebooks if applicable.
